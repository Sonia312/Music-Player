# Music Player

SY Semester-1 Data Structures Project

Topic : Music Player

Details : A simple music player made purely using Java. It lets pick your favorite artist or the complete playlist of all songs. With options for managing playlists, moving to the next or previous song, and repeating tracks, you can enjoy music your way. This project is a great starting point for Java learners, demonstrating how to create common music player features and setting the stage for more advanced projects.
